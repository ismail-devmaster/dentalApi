# How Everything Works

## Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of how the backend of the healthcare management API operates, including server initialization, routing, database interaction, and error handling.

## Server Initialization

- The server is initialized in `server.js`, where the following steps occur:
  - **Environment Variables**: The `dotenv` package loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - **Express Setup**: An Express application is created, and middleware for CORS and body parsing is applied.
  - **Prisma Client**: The Prisma client is instantiated to facilitate database interactions.

## Routing

- The API routes are organized in separate files within the `routes` directory. Each file corresponds to a specific resource (e.g., patients, doctors).
- Each route file exports an Express router that defines the following:
  - **GET Requests**: Fetch data from the database.
  - **POST Requests**: Create new records in the database.
  - **PUT Requests**: Update existing records.
  - **DELETE Requests**: Remove records from the database.

## Database Interaction

- The Prisma client is used to interact with the PostgreSQL database. Each route handler performs CRUD operations using Prisma's methods:
  - `findMany()`: Fetch multiple records.
  - `findUnique()`: Fetch a single record by a unique identifier.
  - `create()`: Insert a new record.
  - `update()`: Modify an existing record.
  - `delete()`: Remove a record.

## Error Handling

- Each route includes error handling to manage exceptions. Common practices include:
  - Logging errors to the console for debugging.
  - Returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).
  - Sending descriptive error messages in the response body.

## Data Validation

- Input validation is performed to ensure that required fields are present and valid before processing requests. This helps prevent invalid data from being stored in the database.

## Database Structure

- The database schema is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`, which includes models for patients, doctors, appointments, payments, specialties, and appointment types. Each model defines the fields and relationships between entities.

## Migrations

- Database migrations are managed using Prisma Migrate. Migrations are created to apply changes to the database schema and are stored in the `prisma/migrations` directory. The migrations can be applied using the Prisma CLI.

## Conclusion

This document outlines the backend architecture and workflow of the healthcare management API. Understanding these components is crucial for maintaining and extending the API functionality.
